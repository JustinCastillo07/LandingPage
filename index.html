    					<h1>Dating Tips #1</h1>
    					<h2>Focus on the present, not the past.</h2>
    					<p>-It's natural to bring your fears and negative experiencs to a new relationship;
							 after all, it's a survival mechanism to prevent getting your heart broken again.
							 But even if old fears and insecurities may prevent heartbreak, they can also prevent
							 heartbreak, they can also prevent you from truly being happy i a new relationship. For 
							example, if a past partner was unfaithful, don't distrust your new partner just because of what
							an ex-relationship was like. Focus on the qualities that make your new partner different. If 
							they're trustworthy enough to date, that means you should trust them.

    					<h1>Dating Tips #2</h1>
    					<h2>Talk about the future early on.</h2>
    					<p>-While you shouldn't focus on the past, you should focus on the future, at least somewhat. Of course,
							you don't need to (and probably shouldn't) ask how many kids they want before the salad course arrives
							on date #1, but you don't want to wait until after one year of dating to find out that they never want to
							get married if marriage is non-negotiable for you. It's not always fun to talk about things like life goals,
							 religion, marriage, politics, etc., but naturally work your deal-breakers into the conversation to make sure
							 you're at least on the same page as soon as you start to see a future together. Also, whether you're looking
							 for a long-term relationship or are looking for more of a casual fling, communicate it.</p>

    					<h1>Dating Tips #3</h1>
    					<h2>Make sure you're attracted to the person, not the idea of a relationship.</h2>
    					<p>-Sometimes, we want to be in a relationship so badly(dating burnout is real)that we don't even realize we're more attracted
							to the idea of a relationship than the person we're in a relationship with. If you're so focused on finding Happily Ever After, you
							run the risk of pushing other people into boxes that they don't belong in(or don't want to be in)or forcing a spark. You 
							overlook flaws or red flags because your mind has already convinced you that has to work. Instead, take your partner at face value.
							 Assume they're not The One. Would they stil be someone you want to spend your time with? If you enjoy their company so much that
							 you'd want to be with them whether or not they were "The One,"then you're likely atracted to them, not just a relationship.

    					<h1>Dating Tips #4</h1>
    					<h2>Spend some time apart.</h2>
    					<p>-A new relationshipis incrdibly exciting. So exciting, in fact, that it's easy to get swept up in your life as a new couple and let the
							routines from your single life dwindle. Maybe you see your friends less often or spend less time on your hobby to spend more time with your
							new partner. Sure, it's a great sign that you want to be together all the time, but spending all of your time together (and giving up your own
							independence and social life)could set you up for a relationship disaster. No matter what, make sure you don't lose your friends or yourself.
							 Avoid constantly texting or calling, and try your best to act like nothing has changed in your friendships (because it shouldn't have!). You
							 shouldn't be looking for the person to share one life with; you're looking for the person to share your life with.

    					<h1>Dating Tips #5</h1>
    					<h2>Meet each other's friends.</h2>
    					<p>-Since the relationship is new, you may be tempted to keep it all to yourself. However, meeting friends early on crucial. The way you interact with
							each other's crew can give insight into your partnerand what the relationship will be like. For example, if all of your partner's friends are huge
							douches you would never get along with, you might not know your partner as well as you think you do (who chooses to hang out with douches if they're not a douche themselves, ya know?).
